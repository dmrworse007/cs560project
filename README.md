# Solar System VR/AR Visualization Project

This project is an interactive 3D Solar System visualization developed using A-Frame, AR.js, WebGL, and WebXR. 
It supports both Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) modes and was created as part of my CS560 course project.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Full 3D Solar System simulation  
- Planet rotation & revolution animations  
- VR mode with WebXR (A-Frame)  
- AR mode using marker-based AR.js  
- Independent pages for each planet  
- Runs entirely in the browser (no installation required)

---

## 🎯 Project Motivation
Understanding planetary scale, space, and orbits through 2D images is difficult. 
This project uses immersive VR and AR to make the Solar System more intuitive, interactive, and educational. 
It is intended for demos, teaching, and experimentation with XR (Extended Reality) technologies.
